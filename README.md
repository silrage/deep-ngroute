Custom template for custom deep-links in angular-route
*****************************************************************

HI! This is my very simple project for attach dynamic route menu from Angular.

How it works?
- Copy to you localhost path or run you webserver from project directory and run index.html for see this project
- I take htaccess for run subdir 'cdeep', you will create another from this file

Thanks for watch & forks!
